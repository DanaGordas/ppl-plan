## PEOPLE'S PLAN

This project contains one Ruby on Rails API backend app and one React front-end app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can start by: 

## Backend app: 

### `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`

Creates the database, adds the tables and populates it with data

### `rails s -p 3001`

Runs the backend app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.<br />
To view the backend data you need to add the api endpoint e.g: [http://localhost:3001/api/games](http://localhost:3001/api/answers) 

## Frontend app:

### `yarn install`

Installs project's dependencies

### `yarn --cwd client start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
