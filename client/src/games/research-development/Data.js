        description: "Create a new generation of reactors, with improved safety and lower costs. They are called Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). They use advanced tech to be smaller and more flexible. They could help create zero carbon energy, and even help create synthetic aviation fuels. If done right, this industry could create tens of thousands of new jobs as part of the energy transition.",

We could create better ways to reuse and transform waste into energy. Research in this area could create lots of green jobs and create all kinds of new biofuels and processes.",

Doing more research into the various chemical and other types of batteries will improve energy storage, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, save consumers money and make the electricity system more reliable and resilient",

With long coastlines and large tidal ranges, the UK is a good candidate for ocean technology. Wave and tidal stream energy has potential to meet up to 20% of our electricity demand and there are already a number of ongoing small scale projects using these technologies.",

Carbon capture is a particularly useful technology to help lower emissions from ‘hard to reach’ areas, such as heavy industry, or in developing countries whose economies may rely on fossil fuels to power development for decades to come.",

It does not require expensive adjustments or infrastructure to aid the transition and has already made great leaps in development. For example, through research we have already developed advanced biofuels, and can now produce biohydrogen which fuels vehicles with zero emissions.",
