    intro: "Your town is mapping a pathway to carbon neutral. Keeping the lights on whilst achieving this target will require some ambitious thinking. Help choose a path.",
    instructions: "You have 10 power tokens. Use them wisely. You can invest up to three tokens in any one idea. The more tokens you put into an idea the more the town will focus on that policy. Drag the tokens onto the lightbulb to invest."

Solar energy is likely to become 20-50% cheaper than previously estimated with annual electricity bill savings in the region of £270 for the average family home.",
